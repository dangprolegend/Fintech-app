            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Data is an integral component to the operation of U-Connect. Being an application centered around investment, maintaining a functional database of investment data is vital to providing the best possible experience to users. Our application makes use of two different categories of asset-specific data and market-wide data, in addition to user-base specific data.<br><br>
                The first and arguably most important data requirement for U-Connect is an aggregated database of asset specific historical price data. Our database includes the open, high, low, and close data for each asset available through our platform at various time intervals ranging from as granular as five minutes and as large as one week. This data is both used within our app for functions such as displaying graphs of asset prices at various timeframes and is also available in the form of a dataframe in which users can use to view data in numerical form. This is an  important data requirement as being able to display the price action of assets is crucial to allowing users to understand the assets they are investing in.<br><br>
                Another equally important data requirement is a database containing a market snapshot pertaining to each asset. This is separate from our database of historical data, as it needs to constantly be updated through a data provider and contains additional information that is not available at longer timeframes. This market snapshot contains data that pertains to the current moment such as the current best bid and ask price quotes and their sizes, the one hour, one day, and one week change in price, as well as the assets aggregated trade volume. Providing the most up-to-date and relevant information to users (as feasible) is imperative to allowing users to ensure that users are able to invest in the fairest way possible.<br><br>
                In addition to these asset-specific data requirements, UConnect also seeks to provide users with broader market-wide data that allows them to make decisions based on the entire context of the market. This data includes statistics like the overall implied volatility of an asset-class or sector, in addition to meta-information like newly minted assets and assets that are growing in popularity. This information can be used to recommend new assets to users and can help increase user engagement by allowing them to gain a more up to date understanding of the areas that they are investing in.<br><br>
                Finally our application collects data on its user base and uses it to continue to further provide helpful insights back to users. Statistics like the average portfolio composition of users and popular assets among users can help to determine common trends among users, which we can then use to help recommend assets to other users. Similarly, we can collect useful information such as the growth of users’ portfolios and their value at risk in order to help prevent users from losing money.

                    The U-INVEST user interface has been designed to simplify the student investment process, providing a clear user interface with a priority being placed on displaying relevant information. Across the application, the “U-INVEST” title and navigation bar remain consistent on each page, highlighting the text in the navigation bar to indicate the current page. 
                </p>
                <img src="images/home_page.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe" id="home_wireframe">
                <p>
                    The <b>Home Page</b> wireframe provides students with all information they would frequently check. This includes the total value of their portfolio, percent changes overtime, and a large graph displaying the value of their portfolio over time. These values will be refreshed each time a student reloads the webpage.
                </p>
                <img src="images/history_page.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe" id="history_wireframe">
                <p>
                    The <b>History Page</b> wireframe shows the student their transaction history via rows and columns with entries. Each row represents a UCard transaction, showing the date/time, the amount the transaction was rounded up to, and the amount rounded up minus the original transaction amount. The bottom of this page will show the total amount the student collected for investments over time.
                </p>
                <img src="images/invest_page.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe" id="invest_wireframe">
                <p>
                    The <b>Invest Page</b> wireframe allows students to invest the money they collected from rounding up their UCard transactions. This page consists of a large search textbox, where once the student begins typing, search suggestions will appear. Under the search box, the app will display the recent searches along with their dates.
                </p>
                <img src="images/explore_page.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe" id="explore_wireframe">
                <p>
                    The <b>Explore Page</b> wireframe allows students to explore stock/cryptocurrency charts. The top of this page consists of a search field, title of the current pair being explored, and invest button. The bottom half of the page is split in half, one half is dedicated to the chart of the current pair, and the other half is for community discussion. The discussion section of this page will allow students to discuss the current pair with a chat-style interface. Each pair will have its own unique chatroom.

                This project fulfills the IE requirements by being a collection of financial technology knowledge learned both via general education requirements and through personal experience. In order to fulfill the first IE criteria, our team is applying our knowledge of financial markets to a full-stack web application, helping students effortlessly invest their spare change. This project will be a culmination of the knowledge we’ve learned as computer science students by making use of concepts we’ve learned in this course along with many computer science principles learned earlier in our education.  

                <br><br>The development process of “U-INVEST” will require the use of General Education learning objectives. Development will involve clear communication between team members to make sure all tasks are done efficiently and in a coordinated manner. We will also use our critical thinking abilities to integrate both existing and new financial data into our application. This will involve the use of many data API’s combined with many mathematical calculations needed to accurately determine students’ investments and portfolio movements. This project is a prime example of applying existing knowledge to new situations; our team has extensive knowledge of both financial markets and technology, this project will combine these two knowledge fields into something entirely new and unexplored.
