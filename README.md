### U-invest
U-invest is an innovative mobile app designed specifically for UMass students, inspired by the popular Acorns app. The app aims to promote financial literacy and long-term wealth-building habits among the student body by enabling effortless investment opportunities.

### Project Vision
Whenever students use their UCards to make purchases at places like Harvest Markets, UPubs, or vending machines, the U-invest app will automatically round up the transaction amount to the nearest dollar (or other desired increment). These round-up amounts will then be pooled and invested into various investment vehicles such as Bitcoin ETFs, ETFs, or other suitable options.

The core vision of U-invest is to provide a simple yet powerful platform that allows students to build an investment portfolio while enjoying the convenience of using their UCards for everyday expenses. By leveraging the power of micro-investments and automating the process, U-invest seeks to make investing more accessible and engaging for the UMass student community.
